# Digital-Clock
A digital clock with a date display made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple application that displays the current time and date in a digital format. The clock consists of a container element that holds the clock and date displays and a set of CSS styles that define the layout and appearance of the clock. The JavaScript code uses the Date object to retrieve the current time and date and updates the clock and date displays every second using the setInterval method. The clock can be customized with different colors, fonts, and styles to suit the user's preferences. The resulting clock is a useful and visually appealing tool that can be easily embedded into any webpage or application.
